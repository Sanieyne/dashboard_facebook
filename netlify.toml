[build]

The publish directory remains correct

publish = "build/web"

We remove the custom command entirely

[build.environment]

Specify the Flutter version you need. The plugin will handle the install.

We'll stick to your requested version 3.47.0.

FLUTTER_VERSION = "3.47.0"

Add the Flutter Build Plugin

[[plugins]]
package = "netlify-plugin-flutter"

If you need to specify the exact build command (e.g., if you have flavors),

you can use build.command, but the plugin handles flutter build web by default.

If you only need 'flutter build web', you can omit the command line.

I'll include 'flutter build web' here for clarity, though it's often optional with the plugin.

[build]
command = "flutter build web"
